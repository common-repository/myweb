* Add landmark roles to all links: one of WordPress’ common trends, is to show an excerpt of a post with hyperlinks that’ll let you read the full content. These links are usually represented with plain boring text. Which makes it difficult for users to differentiate between the excerpted contents that those links represent. By default, WordPress links are excerpted with words like “continue reading”, “more” or an equivalent text. This can pose a lot of problem with your site’s accessibility. However, With our WORDPRESS ACCESSIBILITY plugin on your dash, you can add titles to all your links. So instead of using “continue reading” to represent excerpted links on your site, it’ll show “ continue reading + preferred title”.

This plugin can save time and effort from manually editing each image one by one to change the assigned title attributes of featured images.
